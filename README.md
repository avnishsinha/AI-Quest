# 🧠 AI Quest: A Generative AI Text Adventure Game  

Welcome to **AI Quest**, an interactive text-based adventure game powered by **Generative AI**. This project explores the potential of AI-driven storytelling, creating a dynamic and immersive narrative experience where players shape their own journey through AI-generated content.  

## 🎮 About the Project  

**AI Quest** is designed to leverage generative AI models to create unique, evolving game scenarios based on player inputs. Unlike traditional text-based games with predefined paths, our system dynamically constructs narratives, characters, and choices in real time, making each playthrough a one-of-a-kind adventure.  

## 🚀 Features  

- **AI-Generated Narratives** – No fixed storylines; AI crafts responses and scenarios as you play.  
- **Dynamic Player Choices** – Your decisions influence the world, characters, and storyline.  
- **Adaptive AI** – The game learns from past interactions to create a personalized adventure.  
- **Multi-Genre Experience** – Play in different settings like fantasy, sci-fi, mystery, and more.  

## 🛠️ Technologies  

We are still finalizing the tech stack, but possible tools include:  
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript  
- **AI Models**: OpenAI’s GPT, Llama, or similar LLMs  
- **Backend**: Flask / FastAPI  
- **Frontend**: React / Next.js (if applicable)  
- **Database**: Firebase, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB  

## 👥 Team  

This project is developed as part of **CS399: Generative AI in Software Development** by a team of three dedicated students. Given the semester timeline, we aim to keep development realistic and achievable within our constraints.  

## 📌 Project Scope  

Since we are already **six weeks into the semester**, we are prioritizing:  
- A **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** that delivers core AI-driven gameplay.  
- A simple yet engaging **game interface** (CLI or web-based).  
- Optimized **story generation logic** to ensure engaging player experiences.
